Environment variables are useful for storing configuration settings and sensitive information that can be accessed by your application at runtime. They provide a way to separate configuration from code, making it easier to manage different environments (such as development, staging, and production) without modifying the code itself. Additionally, environment variables can be used to store API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data, keeping them secure and separate from your codebase.
